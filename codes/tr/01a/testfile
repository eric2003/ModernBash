Linux networks are becoming more and more common, 
but scurity is often an overlooked  
issue. Unfortunately, in todayâ€™s environment all networks 
are potential hacker targets,  
fro0m tp-secret military research networks to small home LANs.  
Linux Network Securty focuses on securing Linux in a 
networked environment, where the  
security of the entire network needs to be considered
rather than just isolated machines.  
It uses a mix of theory and practicl techniques to 
teach administrators how to install and  
use security applications, as well as how the 
applcations work and why they are necesary.
