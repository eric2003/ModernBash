#Using the cat Command to Suppress Empty Lines
#To suppress repeated empty lines, and safe space on your display you can use the -s option. 
#Keep in mind that this option will keep one blank line by removing the repeated empty lines only. 
#The command would look like this:
#cat -s filename.txt

cat -s filename.txt
