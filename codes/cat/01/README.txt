LINUX NETWORKS ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE COMMON, BUT SCURITY IS OFTEN AN OVERLOOKED  
ISSUE. UNFORTUNATELY, IN TODAY’S ENVIRONMENT ALL NETWORKS ARE POTENTIAL HACKER TARGETS,  
FROM TP-SECRET MILITARY RESEARCH NETWORKS TO SMALL HOME LANS.  
LINUX NETWORK SECURTY FOCUSES ON SECURING LINUX IN A NETWORKED ENVIRONMENT, WHERE THE

USE SECURITY APPLICATIONS, AS WELL AS HOW THE APPLCATIONS WORK AND WHY THEY ARE NECESARY.
