Sed Command in Linux/Unix with examples

Printing only the replaced lines : Use the -n option along with the /p print flag to display only the replaced lines. Here the -n option suppresses the duplicate rows generated by the /p flag and prints the replaced lines only one time.

If you use -n alone without /p, then the sed does not print anything.
