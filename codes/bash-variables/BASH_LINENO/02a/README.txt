BASH_LINENO
An array variable whose members are the line numbers in source files where each corresponding member of FUNCNAME was invoked. 
${BASH_LINENO[$i]} is the line number in the source file (${BASH_SOURCE[$i+1]})
where ${FUNCNAME[$i]} was called (or ${BASH_LINENO[$i-1]} if referenced within another shell function). 
Use LINENO to obtain the current line number.
